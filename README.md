# Spin JS SDK

This is an SDK for Javascript and Typescript based on [ComponentizeJS](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/ComponentizeJS).

The templates can be installed with the following command:

```

## Creating and building a new app

```bash
spin new -t http-ts hello-world -a
cd hello-world
npm install
spin buiild
```

## Running the app

```bash
spin up
```

## Note: Installing the package

Currently pre-release versions are published on NPM and can be installed using the following command:
